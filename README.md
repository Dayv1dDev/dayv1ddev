I am a Junior Front-end Developer and a Web development student who is filled with the enthusiasm to start working in further projects. I consider myself a person that it's going to work very hard to overcome and achieve the challenges and goals I will have in my near future. 

Right now, I am expanding my knowledge to new technologies and languages through out Front-end development mainly, even so, I am open to learn Back-end as my final goal is to be a Full Stack developer.
